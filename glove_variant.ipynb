        "Representing words as dense vectors over a finite-dimensional space was one of the recent breakthroughs in Natural Language Processing. Vectorial representations allow space-efficient, informationally rich storage of words that adequately captures their semantic content and enables numerical computation on them. Word vectors are the standard input representation for machine learning architectures for language processing. Even though new methods for constructing such representations emerge frequently, the original set of published papers remain a de facto point of reference as well as a good starting point. For this assignment, you will be asked to implement a small-scale variant of one such paper, namely [Global Word Vectors for Word Representation](https://nlp.stanford.edu/pubs/glove.pdf) (\"the GloVe paper\").\n",

        "Notes on the paper will appear throughout the notebook to guide you along the code. It is, however, important to read and understand the paper, its terminology and the theory behind it before attempting to go through with the assignment. Some of the tasks will also require addressing the paper directly.\n",

        "**ANSWER**: When correlating Harry to his friends Hermione and Ron, we expect to see an almost identical value when mesuring the probability of having the word 'harry' in the context of both words because the two characters occur often in the same context throughout the story. The Probing returns 1.06 as value meaning that Harry is slightly more correlated to Ron than to Hermione though in general we can say there is no evident prevalence. Technically, when probing, the probability that the word 'ron' is predicted by the word 'harry' (the numerator) is almost identical to the probability that the word 'hermione' is predicted by the word 'harry' (the denominator), thus the ratio is close to 1 and we conclude that 'harry' is not a good discriminator word.\n",

Since horcruxes are objects created by Voldemort and used by him to preserve his soul throughout the whole saga, it's natural to have them near to the character who created it, meaning that during the narration both the words are often recurring in the same context. The value is indeed high ($\\sim 9.3$). On the contrary, the basilisk is not directly correlated to Voldemort and appears in its context much less and also only in one book. Moreover, since the horcruxes are more than one, in the story they are usually referred in the plural form. As a matter of fact, when probing horcruxes in the plural form, the value is even higher ($\\sim 16.7)$"

This is reflected by the high similarity score. Also 'cruciatus' and 'imperius' are interchangeable as they are the same type of entity (they're both \"spells\"). We expected similarity to be higher, but the network still captured that they are related. 'avada' and 'kedavra' on the other hand, are not interchangeable but appear together throughout the whole series, thus it could be expected that their similarity score would be high. Finally, the model captures well the meaning of the word 'hagrid' as it is more similar to 'giant' than 'goblin'. These are both fantastic creatures, but Hagrid is a half-giant and not a goblin."

        "**ANSWER**: In general all the most similar words make sense. Based on our knowledge of the books, we can say that the word we would reckon is the most similar either appears as the top word or it appears in one of the following 5 words. The only exception is represented by 'wand'. Here we have 'harry' which is a word usually associated with 'wand' but some strongly related word such as 'magic' is missing.\n",
        "\n",
        " There are not many errors. Most notably 'lady' in 'marauder' and 'fer' in 'forbidden' or 'nigellus' in 'myrtle'. We reckon these words are quite specific and do not have many words strictly related to them. Therefore, the model just chooses words that appear frequently in their context. For instance, Hagrid usually goes to the 'forbidden' forest and says 'fer' instead of 'for' and thus we see 'fer' appears in the related words of 'forbidden'. Broadly speaking, as mentioned in the introduction, the corpus for training is quite smaller than typical corpuses used for such tasks, and thus we can expect the model to not generalize as best as it can.\n",
        "\n",
        " In general, we mostly see instances of relatedness rather than similarity. Two words are said to be similar when they can be used interchangeably in the same context, while they are semantically related if they usually appear close in the sentences. In our case, the best example of similar words is 'hogwarts' which can easily be substituted by 'slytherin', 'hufflepuff', 'ravenclaw' (the hogwarts' houses) which appear in the list of most similar words. However, even in this case, the one most similar word is 'points' which is related not similar (\"50 points to Griffyndor!\"). Another good example of relatedness is 'quidditch'. No words in the list of most similar words can substitute the word 'quidditch' in a sentence but they are all semantically related."

        "**ANSWER**: The model guesses correctly for instance in the case of 'avada' is to 'kedavra' as 'expecto' is to 'patronum' which is the first guess of the model. When the model does not guess the first word correctly, the right word is typically in the top 5. When the model is incorrect, it typically just outputs words that are loosely related to one of the given words or even to the word it should have guessed. For instance in \"dungeon is to slytherin as tower is to...\", the correct answer would be 'gryffindor' but we get 'points' which is related to 'gryffindor' itself. This is due to the fact that we are using arithmetic in the representation space and thus we end up with a vector that is similar to 'gryffindor', in this case 'points'."
